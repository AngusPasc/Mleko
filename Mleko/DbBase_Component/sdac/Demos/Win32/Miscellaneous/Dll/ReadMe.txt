Demonstrates creating and loading DLLs for SDAC-based projects. This demo
project consists of two parts - an MS_Dll project that creates a DLL of a
form that sends a query to the server and displays its results, and an
MS_Exe project that can be executed to display a form for loading and
running this DLL. Allows you to build a dll for one SDAC-based project
and load and test it from a separate application.
